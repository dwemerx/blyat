# BLYAT Compose Files

A collection of compose files used by BLYAT. If you are going to self-host, a 1 GB RAM VPS should be enough for personal use.

WARNING: if you are going to self-host, read through the files before you run anything. Some of them won't work out of the box and require minor configuration (which is pretty easy, though)

## Services

Each folder represents a service. Remove all labels if you are not going to use Traefik as the reverse proxy.

## Traefik

Current config scores A on [SSL Labs](https://www.ssllabs.com/ssltest) and I plan to keep it this way.

## Front Page

There is a repository for the front page too. You can check out the code [here](https://github.com/dwemerx/blyat-front)
